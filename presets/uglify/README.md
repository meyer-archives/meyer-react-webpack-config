# wub-preset-uglify

This [wub preset][] enables production minification with `uglifyjs-webpack-plugin`. It is equivalent to running `webpack` with the `-p` flag, with two exception: itâ€™s using the beta version of Uglify v3, and Uglify options can be configured.

| Config option | Required? | Description |
